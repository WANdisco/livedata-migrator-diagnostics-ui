* Input field for a date/time. Consume text in different formats and 
map to timestamp, go to closest timestamp in the data set.

*  Latencies hard to read on transfer page - have a timeline
diagram that covers the stages: source event creation, action
queued, transfer started etc. This can have the deltas between
the stages.

* Scrolling slider and looking at graphs can be hard as they 
do not always fit on page, particularly when there are multiple graphs.
Options include making graphs smaller (makes them hard to read), have
multiple sliders with one per graph that are linked together, floating
slider.

* Orange on Navigation bar clashes with graphs - use a darker orange.

* Per file transfer page can show stalls but it is hard to map 
back to the system as timestamps might not match. The per file transfer page
is at second granularity. However, it should be possible to map to the nearest
diagnostic. 

* For tables that have been sorted if you move the slider to point in 
graph to load new data into table the sorting is lost. The sorted tables
are done with sorttable (https://www.kryogenix.org/code/browser/sorttable/)
which is easy to use but has limitations. If moving to a different approach
(https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_sort_table.asp) would also allow
support of units (eg display in KiB, MiB, GiB).

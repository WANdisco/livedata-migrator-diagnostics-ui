* Input field for a date/time. Consume text in different formats and map to timestamp, go to closes timestamp in the data set.

* Diagnostics for Event RPC from NN not plotted. Tells health of HDFS cluster.

* "Capture time" on transfer page is confusing.

*  Latencies hard to read on transfer page - have transition diagram with times between transitions.

* Failures, Retries Pending Regions etc graphs can be order of millions - changes of 100K can be hard to see in graph. Provide log option.

* Graph is slow for long time sets.

* Scrolling slider and looking at graphs can be hard as they do not always fit on page - float the slider to always appear on page? (Mulitple sliders was a PITA).

* Provide some delta's on the diagnostics page - change in retries over period etc.
